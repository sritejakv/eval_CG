```Sriteja Kummita, Goran Piskachev, Johannes Spaeth, and Eric Bodden. 2021. Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Callgraph Algorithms for Python. In Proceedings of the First International Conference on Code Quality (ICCQ â€™21). To appear.```

* Two experiments are described in the paper, namely, Synthetic Test and Real-world Test. Synthetic test focuses on evaluation the callgraph algorithms in terms of their quality and Real-world test focuses on quantitative evaluation of the callgraph algorithms.

* In both the experiments, three frameworks are considered, namely, [Code2flow](https://github.com/scottrogowski/code2flow), [Pyan](https://github.com/DavidFraser/pyan), and [Wala](https://github.com/wala/WALA). 

* The dynamic callgraph is generated using [PyCallGraph](https://pycallgraph.readthedocs.io/en/master/). This callgraph is considered as the ground truth in both the experiments.

## Run the experiments
* Please refer to the documentation inside each directory (`synthetic_test`, and `real_world_test`) for the instructions to reproduce the resutls discussed in the publication.
